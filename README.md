Convert Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI/SMF) compositions to Wonderswan Music Macro Language (MML) files that is readable and editable. Tool to improve the development process of WonderSwan chipmusic (DAW => MIDI conversion => MIDI2MML => MML2FX => FX2WSC). Intended to work with the [Wonderswan Total Sound Driver (WTD)] (http://shaw.la.coocan.jp/wtd/) which was created by S.W. There are SMF2MML converters out there however a readily available one for the WS is much needed for easy implemention.
